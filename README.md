# Expert-AWS

General AWS Repo. Please check individual AWS-* repos for specific works.

AWS is vast. Unless I capture what I find useful the moment I am reading or referencing a source I am lost. And then there is the organization of the materials burden which if not performed well, it is hard to start and finish a project, let alone seeing through to the end of a thread of thought when the mind is overwhelmed with so much data and information. This repo is designed to address some of those challenges throughout the journey from a beginner level to an expert.
