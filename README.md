# Expert-AWS

General AWS Repo. Please check individual AWS-* repos for specific works.

AWS is vast. Unless I capture what I find useful the moment I am reading or referencing a source I am lost. And then there is the organizing the materials burden which is not performed well, it is hard to start and finish a project or even a thread of thought. This repo is designed to address some of those challenges.
